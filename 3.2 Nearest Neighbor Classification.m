##Nearest Neighbor Classification
One of the most straightforward ways of categorizing a new sample is to find known samples that are similar to the new sample, and assign the new sample to the same class. This is a basic idea behind k-nearest neighbors classification.



When using this method, we do not have to make any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data.
