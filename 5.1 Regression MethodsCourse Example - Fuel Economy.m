#Building Regression Models

Example: Vehicle Fuel Economy
Fuel economy is a key part of a motor vehicleâ€™s technical specifications, and it can be an important consideration for many people when choosing a vehicle to purchase.

A vehicle's fuel economy is, in turn, impacted by many of the vehicle's other specifications, such as the size of the vehicle and the size of the engine. It would be useful for an automobile manufacturer to be able to predict fuel economy based these other specifications.

Because fuel economy is a continuous measure, the prediction model will be a regression model, with the various technical specifications as the predictor variables and fuel economy as the response. The model could be used for various purposes, for example

#Task1
The Regression Learner trains models to perform regression. Using this app, you can explore supervised machine learning using various regression models.
Task
Click New Session. Select carTrain as the training data and FuelEcon as the response variable. Click Start Session.

#Task2
You can select, train, and evaluate different models using the Regression Learner.
Task
Select the Linear Regression model by choosing it from the Models section.

then Train All the models

#Task3
Typically, you may want to train several models and select the one with the best performance.
Task
Select the models Quadratic SVM and Narrow Neural Network. Train the new models

#Task4
To verify that your model performs well on new and unseen data, you can import and evaluate your model on a test dataset.
Task
Navigate to the Test tab.
Click Test Data.
Select carTest as the testing data.
Click Import.
Click Test All.
